# Advent of Code

rust-lang/rustlings, but with `a few modifications :)`.

This repository will probably include solutions from any year _in the future_, see folder `year`.

_Tested on Linux. Does not run on Windows._

## Run

```bash
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- file FILENAME # runs the specified file
cargo run -- year YEAR # runs all puzzles for the specified year
```

### Example

```bash
cargo run -- file 2021_1 # runs 2021_1.rs: year 2021 - day 1
cargo run -- year 2021 # runs all puzzles for 2021
```
