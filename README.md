# Advent of Code

This repository will probably include solutions from any year _in the future_, see folder `year`.

_Tested on Linux. Does not run on Windows, actually, maybe it does._

## Run

```bash
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- puzzle <year> <day> # runs the specified puzzle
```

### Example

```bash
cargo run -- puzzle 2021 1 # runs the puzzle released in 2021 day 1
```
